# SpendAware frontend

SpendAware is a small application made for Cyber security course of mooc.fi in 2016-2017, organized in collaboration by F-Secure and the department of computer science of University of Helsinki.

This repository is the frontend for my application. The purpose of this project, as defined by the course, is to create a web application that intentionally has at least five different security flaws from the  OWASP top ten list.

The idea in my project specifically was to have a simple app you could use to track your spending.
It's mostly made for the purposes of this course though, and as such it's rather lacking in features.
